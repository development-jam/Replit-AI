🎮 **Game Development**
- Built-in windowing system
- Sprite and texture management
- Physics and collision detection
- Audio system integration
- Input handling (keyboard, mouse, gamepad)

📊 **Data Science & ML**
- Matrix and DataFrame operations
- Statistical analysis functions
- Linear regression and clustering
- Data visualization capabilities
- Parallel processing for large datasets

🌐 **Networking & Concurrency**
- HTTP/HTTPS client and server
- WebSocket support
- TCP/UDP socket programming
- Async/await pattern
- Threading and parallel processing

🔧 **Advanced Language Features**
- Object-oriented programming with inheritance
- Generics and template system
- Error handling with try/catch
- Package management and modules
- Reflection and meta-programming

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC, Clang)
- Python 3.7+ (for development tools)

### Building
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/replit-language.git
cd replit-language

# Build the interpreter
make

# Run basic demo
make demo

# Run advanced feature showcase
make advanced-demo
```

### Hello World
```replit
// Save as hello.rpl
print "Hello, World!";
print "Welcome to Replit Language!";

// Run with: ./replit hello.rpl
```

### Advanced Example
```replit
// Object-oriented programming
class Player {
    var health: int = 100;
    var position: Vector2;
    
    fn new(x: float, y: float) -> Player {
        this.position = Vector2(x, y);
        return this;
    }
    
    fn update(deltaTime: float) {
        // Game logic here
        if (Input.is_key_down("W")) {
            position.y -= 100 * deltaTime;
        }
    }
}

// Game development
var window = Window("My Game", 800, 600);
var player = Player(400, 300);

while (!window.should_close()) {
    var deltaTime = Time.get_delta();
    player.update(deltaTime);
    
    window.clear();
    window.render_sprite(player.sprite);
    window.present();
}
```

## Example Applications

- **🎮 Asteroid Shooter** - Complete game with physics and audio
- **💬 Real-time Chat Server** - Networking with WebSockets
- **🖼️ Image Editor** - GUI application with advanced tools
- **📈 Data Science Toolkit** - ML algorithms and visualization

## Language Syntax

### Variables and Types
```replit
var name: string = "Replit";
var age: int = 25;
var score: float = 99.5;
var active: bool = true;
```

### Functions
```replit
fn calculate(x: int, y: int) -> int {
    return x * y + 10;
}

var result = calculate(5, 3);
```

### Classes and Inheritance
```replit
class Animal {
    protected var name: string;
    
    virtual fn speak() -> string {
        return "Some sound";
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    override fn speak() -> string {
        return "Woof!";
    }
}
```

### Collections
```replit
var numbers = Array<int>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var scores = Map<string, int>();
scores["Alice"] = 95;
scores["Bob"] = 87;
```

## Performance
